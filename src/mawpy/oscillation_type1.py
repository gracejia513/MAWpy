# 1. If a pair of traces appears multiple times in a trajectory, and one of them is identified as oscillation, then all occurrences of this pair will be "corrected" (even if other occurrences are not osscilation).
# 2. Only stay locations are corercted. Traces with oscillations are not dealt with.
# 3. Oscilation is required to bound back to the exact same location.
# 4. Line 115 should also consider trace locations (i.e. adding a trace to a stay)


"""
Things to cross check in the future:
1. While creating orig_index, the current trace is deleted from tracelist if the just previous trace has same GPS coordinates as well as duration. The difference in time stampsis not noted.
2. For creating the replacement dictionary, if a stay point is not found we just take the first index of SuspSequence as the replacing index - Why?
3. Time Complexity
